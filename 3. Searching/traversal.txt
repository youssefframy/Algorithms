//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
Breadth first search (BFS)
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS because the solution are rare
//If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS will need too much memory)
//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS
//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS (Depth for search)
//Finding the shortest path:
BFS
